# HCI-Project (Reel the Real)

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented
switch to virtual gatherings. Tools like Zoom, Slack, Teams
etc, which were originally designed to support the one-to-many
group meetings, had turned out to be a way for all the virtual
meetings. This demanded a need for a video conferencing
tool that focus more on providing in-person feel to cater to
the specific large gatherings like conferences and career fairs.
We propose Reel the Real, a web based application which
helps to solve this need, through a navigable virtual room
with proximity based communications. We did a user study to
evaluate the system we built and derived insights which shows
that users are more likely to prefer our application for many-
to-many gatherings with no privacy concerns. This is one of
the first works to study the usability of web-based navigable
virtual gatherings that need no sophisticated devices.
